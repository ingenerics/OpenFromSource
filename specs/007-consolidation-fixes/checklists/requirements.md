# Specification Quality Checklist: Consolidation Fixes

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Feature**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- 10 user stories, 20 functional requirements — exactly at the constitution IX cap
- Source document: full-codebase audit of specs 001–006
- Clarifications integrated in spec: depth setting kept, circular storage location, virtual_resolutions deletion scope, config log_dir parity
- Ready for implementation
